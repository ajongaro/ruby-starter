# Basic Ruby Project Template

This template has a basic Gemfile with three dependencies already installed and initialized:
- Rubocop, a static code analyzer
- RSpec, a robust testing framework
- SimpleCov, a testing coverage analyzer


## Instructions
When creating a new Github repo, select this ruby_project repo in the template dropdown menu, and then clone your project locally as usual.

This should save a decent amount of time when starting new basic ruby projects.

## Notes
- SimpleCov has already been added to the spec_helper.rb file so you won't have to do anything to get it started, and will run automatically whenever you run rspec.
- Please add suggestions on how to improve this starter repo by adding issues or comments.

Happy coding!
